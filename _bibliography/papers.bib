abstract = {Social isolation is a common experience for LGBT+ older adults (OAs) that is often compounded by prejudices of age, sexuality, or gender identity. Little research has explored the specific social needs and barriers that LGBT+ OAs face, particularly in online spaces. To address this gap, we conducted interviews with 10 LGBT+ OAs and an inclusive housing service provider. Our research highlights the importance of LGBT+ community engagement and digitally-supported social networks’ role for LGBT+ OAs. We identify challenges such as managing online identity, navigating LGBT+ social media apps and websites, as well as digital disconnectedness challenges among those with lower digital literacy. Recommendations include improving social platforms allowing LGBT+ OAs to manage selective identity characteristics, promoting genuineness and trust in LGBT+ platforms by employing tiered blocking and interest-driven connections, and non-digital outreach strategies for collaborations between LGBT+ organizations and senior centers to engage hidden and isolated LGBT+ OAs.},

abstract = {This project addresses the rising issue of excessive energy consumption in student accommodations across the UK which has shown a 20\% increase from 2022 to 2023. Student accommodations provide a unique context due to the communal proximity of its inhabitants and students who are not directly responsible for a separate utility bill. Through a mixed-method user research process, 28 questionnaires and 7 interviews revealed two key insights - a lack of awareness and motivation for sustainable behavioural change. The project solution, EcoWatt, is an interactive mobile app complemented by a community dashboard, to bridge the gap between awareness and action. Leveraging elements of anthropomorphism and gamification, EcoWatt delivers real-time data visualisations and educational content, empowering users to explore and better manage their energy consumption. Its scope can be broadened to other energy sources and settings, fostering sustainability in various sectors.},
