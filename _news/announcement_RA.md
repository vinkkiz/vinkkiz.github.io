I started my Research Assistant job at **King's College London**, with [Dr Ulrike Hammerbeck](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/ulrike-hammerbeck) and [Dr Timothy Neate](https://tdjneate.github.io/) to investigate pose estimation models for arm kinematics in stroke survivors and co-design an innovative smartphone app with stroke survivors and clinicians for motor rehabilitation.
